- Change dificutly settings for everyone. Should be fairly easy, unless we want to do more (add peacful, etc?)

- CrossMerchantTrade. Especially for summer merchants....

- http://forums.gnomoria.com/index.php?topic=3995.msg31917#new <= More "HOW MANY DO I HAVE"-Icons should be doable.

- A mechanical transistor

- Conveyors

- Search, filter and sort merchants and may other lists as well

- Garbage dump. Some kind of custom storage where items disappear over time.

- Larger storage chests (once custom items&co are in place....)

- Workshops that use mechanical energy as input. Ideas: Sawmill (obvious), Stonecutter, Smiths, Loom

- Improve the military loadouts, by allowing multiple sets & on mutiple levels (e.g. asign a set with weapon only to gnome directly). Lots of work

- Sync tasks across workshops with some kind of templates, similar to the military idea.
