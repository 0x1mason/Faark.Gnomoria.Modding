Gnomodia
========

Gnomodia is a modding framework for the game Gnomoria. Gnomodia is based on a [modding framework made by Faark][faark].

The main goal of Gnomodia is to simplify making changes to the game by modders and to make it easier for both modders and users to have multiple mods running at the same time without there being an incompatibility in how these modifications are done.

Gnomodia is a work in progress, and while it is completely functional, the API and the feature set is prone to change at any moment. While we will try to retain backwards compatibility, this is no guarantee.

Licensing
---------

Gnomodia comes with two licenses.

The primary license for the modding library itself is the **GNU LGPL v3 license**. In short, this means that you can make use of this library (through linking) to make a mod, and license your mod in any way you please, including an all rights reserved, closed source mod.

This leniency only applies to your mod, however. If you make changes to the modding library itself, and you plan to make these changes publicly available, you must also release the source code of the modifications you made, as per the LGPL license requirements.

Every other part of Gnomodia is licensed under the **GNU GPL v3 license**. In short, this means that if you want to make use of any part of these, whether through using its source code directly in your work, or through linking, you must release your entire work under the GNU GPL v3 when you make it publicly available.

If you follow these instructions, it's extremely unlikely that you'll get into any kind of legal trouble. I feel, however, that I must point out that these explanations are not legal advice, and I recommend you read the actual licenses (or accurate non-legalese summaries thereof) to understand what they actually entail for you.
